## Data Description:

Our focus will be on the most essential features of a transaction. In essence, a payment card transaction consists of any amount paid to a merchant by a customer at a certain time. The six main features that summarise a transaction therefore are:

**TRANSACTION_ID**: A unique identifier for the transaction

**TX_DATETIME**: Date and time at which the transaction occurs

**CUSTOMER_ID**: The identifier for the customer. Each customer has a unique identifier

**TERMINAL_ID**: The identifier for the merchant (or more precisely the terminal). Each terminal has a unique identifier

**TX_AMOUNT**: The amount of the transaction.

**TX_FRAUD**: A binary variable, with the value  for a legitimate transaction, or the value  for a fraudulent transaction.
